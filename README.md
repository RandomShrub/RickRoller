# RickRoller
For a 2019 senior prank. More details to follow.

Runs on an Arduino Leonardo, which can pretend to be a keyboard. HC-05 Bluetooth module connected to Serial1. MIT crAPP Inventor 2 app will connect to said bluetooth module and issue the typing commands.

# The Plan
1. Plug this into the back of the journalism computer and log on with my admin account.
2. Install Chrome Remote Desktop (backup plan)
3. Prevent sleep mode.
4. Unplug the peripherals and put tape over the USB port.
5. During period 3 AP English Language and Comp (or period 8 backup), they will be powerless to stop the ultimate rick roll.

# Disclaimer
I am fairly certain that teachers and admins at my school will laugh hysterically at this given the circumstances. This may not be the case at your institution.

# The Result?
I'll keep you posted.
